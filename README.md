# quack
A Chrome extension for fighting echo chambers.

## Usage
When you're searching for support for an argument of yours, click the little blue duck icon in your browser. It'll search opposing arguments in a new tab for you.

You can also highlight text on a page and click the little blue duck icon and Quack will open challenges to the text you highlighted in new tabs.

## Currently developing
- A more sophisticated "invert sentiment" function (which shouldn't be too hard, considering it's ham-fisted text replacement right now).
- Making Quack automatic without making it annoying.
- Applying the Quack philosophy more broadly than Google searches.
