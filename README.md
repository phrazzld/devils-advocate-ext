# quack
A Chrome extension for fighting echo chambers.

## Usage
When you're googling support for an argument of yours, click the little duck icon in your browser. It'll google opposing arguments in a new tab for you.

## Currently developing
- A more sophisticated "invert sentiment" function (which shouldn't be too hard, considering it's ham-fisted text replacement right now).
- Making Quack automatic without making it annoying.
- Applying the Quack philosophy more broadly than Google searches.
